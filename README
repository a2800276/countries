countries

Countries is a collection of data that I find myself needing again and
again and not knowing of a succint place to find every, all together, in
one location and in a useable format.

Currently, the collection contains:

* Country names (English)
* ISO 3166 alpha2, alpha3 and numeric codes
* Currencies with names and alpha and numeric codes and minor unit
  exponent

This information is presented in a number of formats:

* csv
* json
* sql

more may follow as I require them. I would also like to include
application code to access this information should be care to contribute
it.

I will try to update these files as often as necessary and at latest
when I get yelled at loud enough.

The top level directory contains the processed files, the subdirectory `dirty`
contains the dirty work, a number of scripts and hacks to assemble the
information.

Flags

The directory `flags` contains PNG (16X11) flags for convenience. This
set of flags was retrieved from
http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/. The orginal set was missing
flags for the following 3166 entities:

* Antarctica (AQ)
* Saint Barthélemy (BL)
* Bonaire (BQ)
* Curaçao (CW)
* Guernsey (GG)
* Isle of Man (IM)
* Jersey (JE)
* Saint Martin (French part) (MF) (French flag)
* South Sudan (SS)
* Sint Maarten (Dutch part) (SX)

I've added these using flag data from wikipedia. A number of free high
quality flag icon sets are available on the internet, e.g.:

https://github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection

in case you require other formats or resolution. The flag icons here are
png formatted 16x11 pixels in size.

Future expansion may include:

* currency symbols
* date, number and currency formats
* name of languages 
* name of languages, countries and currencies in different languages
* phone- and postcode and basic geocoordinate information
* whatever comes to mind or is offered and makes sense to me.
