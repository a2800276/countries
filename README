countries

Countries is a collection of data that I find myself needing again and
again and not knowing of a succint place to find every, all together, in
one location and in a useable format.

Currently, the collection contains:

* Country names (English)
* ISO 3166 alpha2, alpha3 and numeric codes
* Currencies with names and alpha and numeric codes and minor unit
  exponent

This information is presented in a number of formats:

* csv
* json
* sql

more may follow as I require them. I would also like to include
application code to access this information should be care to contribute
it.

I will try to update these files as often as necessary and at latest
when I get yelled at loud enough.

The top level directory contains the processed files, the subdirectory
contains a number of scripts and hacks to assemble the information.

Future expansion may include:

* flags
* date, number and currency formats
* name of languages 
* name of languages, countries and currencies in different languages
* phone- and postcode and basic geocoordinate information
* whatever comes to mind or is offered and makes sense to me.
